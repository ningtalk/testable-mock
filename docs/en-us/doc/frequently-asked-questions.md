Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. How to mock the fields initialized by `@Autowired` in the class under test?

Create the class under test object directly, and then use the ability of `TestableMock` to access private members to directly assign values to these fields.

#### 2. Can `TestableMock` be used with other mock tools?

`TestableMock` can be safely used together with other mock tools based on dynamic proxy mechanism, such as `Mockito`, `EasyMock`, `Spock`, etc., all belong to this category.

For mock tools that modify the class loader or the bytecode of the class under test, such as `PowerMock` and `JMockit`, there is no yet case to prove that they will conflict with `TestableMock`, but in principle, there may be a risk of incompatibility between the two, Please use with caution.

#### 3. How to implement the mock method when the parent class variable points to the child class object?

In the code, there are often cases of using <u>interface variables or parent class variables</u> to point to an instance of subclasses and calling methods provided by the parent class or subclass.

At this time, follow a principle that the type of the first parameter of the mock method is always the same as the type of the variable that initiated the call.

Therefore, regardless of whether the actually called method comes from the parent class or the subclass, and whether the subclass overrides the method. If the calling variable is of the parent type (or interface type), the first parameter type of the mock method should use the corresponding parent type (or interface) type.

See the use case of the `DemoInheritTest` test class in the Java and Kotlin examples.

#### 4. How to mock generic methods (template methods)?

Just use the same generic parameters directly on the mock method.

See the use case of the `DemoTemplateTest` test class in the Java and Kotlin examples.

> Because JVM has a generic erasure mechanism, you can also directly use the `Object` type to replace generic parameters for Java projects, see the commented out "Second solution" example in the Java version of the `DemoTemplateTest` test class.

#### 5. Why mocking methods in the `String` class in the Kotlin project does not work?

The `String` type in Kotlin language is actually `kotlin.String` instead of `java.lang.String`. However, when this type is built from bytecode, it will be replaced with Java's `java.lang.String` class, so no matter if the mock target is written as `kotlin.String` or `java.lang.String`, it cannot match the original called method.

In actual scenarios, there are very few scenarios where methods in the `String` class need to be mocked, so `TestableMock` has not dealt with this situation specifically.

#### 6. Will the mock definition still be valid when it is **indirectly called** from other test classes?

Equally effective, the scope of mock is the entire test runtime process.

For example, some private methods and external invocation in the `Aaa` class are mocked, mock method are defined in the test class `AaaTest`. When testing the `Bbb` class in another test class `BbbTest`, some mocked methods are invoked indirectly in the `Aaa` class, the actual call will also be routed to the mock method defined in the `AaaTest` class.

#### 7. Can `TestableMock` be used for testing Android projects?

It can be used in combination with [Roboelectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) testing framework.

The `Dalvik` and `ART` virtual machines of the Android system use a bytecode system different from the standard JVM, which will affect the normal functionality of `TestableMock`. The `Roboelectric` framework can run Android unit tests on a standard JVM virtual machine, which is much faster than running unit tests through the Android virtual machine. Recently, most Android App unit tests are written with the `Roboelectric` framework.

#### 8. Meet "Attempt to access non-static member in mock method" error during mocking？

The current design of `TestableMock` does not allow access to the non-`static` members of the test class in the mock method (because the mock method itself will be dynamically modified to the `static` type during runtime). However, some Java statements include building blocks (like `new ArrayList<String>() {{ append("data"); }}`), lambda expression (like `list.stream().map(i -> i. get)`) and so on, will generate additional member method invocations during compilation, causing mock method execution report above error.

The simplest solution is to declare the mock method itself as a `static` type (so that dynamically generated invocation will also be `static` to avoid the errors), for example, the original method is defined as:

```java
@MockMethod
private int getXxx(Demo self) {}
```

Modify it to：

```java
@MockMethod
private static int getXxx(Demo self) {}
```

In the next major iteration (**i.e. `v0.5`**), the mock implementation mechanism will be modified while maintaining the current mock experience. Then, it will be no longer necessary to modify the mock method to a static method, and completely solving this problem.

#### 9. Meet "Command Line is too Long. Shorten command line for ..." error when triggering test in IntelliJ IDE?

This problem is caused by the system `Class Path` content is too long, and has nothing to do with `TestableMock`. However, it should be noted that IntelliJ provides two auxiliary solutions: `JAR manifest` and `classpath file`. If `TestableMock` is used in the test, please select `JAR manifest`.
